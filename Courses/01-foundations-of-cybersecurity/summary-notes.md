# Foundations of Cybersecurity - Summary Notes (Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate)

## Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

### What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. In the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, this module introduces the field and its importance in modern organizations.

- **Security Engineer**: Designs and implements security solutions
- **Security Manager**: Oversees security operations and strategy
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Executive-level security leadership
- **SOC Analyst**: Works in security operations centers to monitor and respond to threats

### Cybersecurity Domains
- Network security
- Cloud security
- Application security
- Identity and access management
- Security operations
- Vulnerability management
- Incident response

## Module 2: The Cybersecurity Landscape

### Current Threat Landscape
- Rapidly evolving threat environment with increasing sophistication
- Growth in ransomware, phishing, and supply chain attacks
- Increased attack surface due to digital transformation and remote work

### Threat Actors
- **Cybercriminals**: Financially motivated attackers targeting organizations
- **Nation-states**: Government-sponsored attackers with political or strategic goals
- **Hacktivists**: Politically or socially motivated attackers
- **Insiders**: Malicious or negligent employees with access to systems
- **Script kiddies**: Inexperienced attackers using pre-made tools

### Common Attack Types
- **Malware**: Software designed to harm or exploit systems (viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware)
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information
- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**: Overwhelming systems to make them unavailable
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting database vulnerabilities through malicious queries
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting communications between parties

## Module 3: Core Security Concepts

### The CIA Triad
The foundation of information security is built on three core principles:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes
- **Integrity**: Maintaining and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data and processing methods
- **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required

### Defense in Depth
A security strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls to protect systems and data. If one layer fails, other layers provide additional protection.

### Principle of Least Privilege
Users and systems should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions, reducing the potential impact of a security breach.

### Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and analyzing potential threats
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implementing controls to reduce risk
- **Risk Acceptance**: Acknowledging and accepting certain risks
- **Risk Transfer**: Shifting risk to another party (e.g., insurance)

## Module 4: Security Roles and Responsibilities

### Cybersecurity Team Structure
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Monitors and responds to security incidents
- **Vulnerability Management Team**: Identifies and remediates vulnerabilities
- **Incident Response Team**: Handles security incidents
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Team**: Ensures compliance with regulations

### Role of a Security Analyst
- Monitor systems and networks for security events
- Investigate security incidents
- Respond to security alerts
- Prepare security reports
- Assist with vulnerability management
- Collaborate with other teams on security matters

### Cross-functional Collaboration
- **IT Team**: Work together on system security and incident response
- **Legal Team**: Address compliance and regulatory requirements
- **Business Teams**: Understand security requirements for their operations
- **Human Resources**: Implement security awareness training

## Module 5: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Exploits

### Threats vs. Vulnerabilities vs. Exploits
- **Threat**: A potential cause of harm to a system or data
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that could be exploited by a threat
- **Exploit**: A piece of software or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability

### Types of Vulnerabilities
- **Software vulnerabilities**: Bugs or flaws in software code (e.g., buffer overflow)
- **Configuration vulnerabilities**: Weak security settings (e.g., default passwords)
- **Human vulnerabilities**: Social engineering, poor security practices (e.g., phishing)
- **Physical vulnerabilities**: Unsecured hardware or facilities (e.g., unlocked server room)

### Vulnerability Management Process
1. **Discovery**: Identify assets and potential vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact of vulnerabilities
3. **Prioritization**: Determine which vulnerabilities to fix first
4. **Remediation**: Apply patches or fixes
5. **Verification**: Ensure vulnerabilities are resolved

## Module 6: Security Controls and Frameworks

### Security Controls
- **Preventive Controls**: Stop threats from occurring (firewalls, access controls)
- **Detective Controls**: Identify threats that have occurred (security monitoring, audits)
- **Corrective Controls**: Respond to and mitigate threats (incident response, backups)

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
A widely adopted framework that provides a common language for cybersecurity. It consists of five core functions:

1. **Identify**: Develop an understanding of the organization's assets and risks
2. **Protect**: Implement controls to protect systems and data
3. **Detect**: Identify security events in a timely manner
4. **Respond**: Take action to address security incidents
5. **Recover**: Restore systems and data to normal operations

### NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
A structured process for managing security risks. Key steps include:

1. Prepare
2. Categorize
3. Select
4. Implement
5. Assess
6. Authorize
7. Monitor

### Other Industry Frameworks
- **ISO 27001**: International standard for information security management
- **COBIT**: Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies
- **ITIL**: Information Technology Infrastructure Library

## Module 7: Security Compliance and Regulations

### Key Regulations
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation (EU) - data protection for EU citizens
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (US healthcare) - protects patient health information
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - protects payment card data
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act - consumer data protection for California residents

### Compliance Processes
- **Risk Assessments**: Identify areas of non-compliance
- **Policy Development**: Create policies to address regulatory requirements
- **Implementation**: Put controls in place to meet compliance standards
- **Audits**: Assess compliance with regulations
- **Remediation**: Address any identified gaps

- **Public**: Information that can be shared freely
- **Internal**: Information for internal use only
- **Confidential**: Information that could cause harm if disclosed
- **Restricted**: Information that requires strict protection

## Module 8: Security Operations and Monitoring

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
A centralized unit responsible for monitoring an organization's security posture, detecting security incidents, and responding to threats.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
A tool that collects and analyzes security log data from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.

### Security Monitoring

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor for malicious activity
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Detect and block threats
- **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**: Automate security processes

### Incident Response Basics
- **Incident Identification**: Detecting and analyzing security incidents
- **Containment**: Limiting damage and preventing spread
