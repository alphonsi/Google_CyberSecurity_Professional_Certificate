# Wireshark Activity - Network Traffic Analysis

## Activity Overview
This activity is designed to help you practice network traffic analysis using Wireshark. You will capture and analyze network packets to identify network issues and security incidents.

## Scenario
You are a network administrator at "TechCorp" and have been asked to investigate a network issue reported by employees. Users are experiencing slow internet connectivity and frequent disconnections.

## Task 1: Wireshark Installation
- Download and install Wireshark from the official website
- Configure Wireshark to capture network traffic
- Test Wireshark installation

## Task 2: Network Traffic Capture
- Connect to the network interface you want to monitor
- Start capturing network traffic
- Capture traffic for at least 5 minutes
- Save the capture file

## Task 3: Packet Analysis
- Open the capture file in Wireshark
- Analyze network packets using Wireshark filters
- Identify network protocols in the capture
- Look for unusual or suspicious traffic

## Task 4: Network Issue Identification
- Identify the root cause of the network issue
- Look for retransmissions, duplicate packets, or errors
- Analyze DNS and DHCP traffic
- Check for network congestion

## Task 5: Security Incident Detection
- Look for signs of security incidents
- Check for unusual port activity
- Look for large data transfers
- Identify potential malware or attacks

## Task 6: Report Creation
- Create a network traffic analysis report
- Include key findings from the analysis
- Provide recommendations for improving network performance and security
- Save the report as a PDF

## Deliverables
- Wireshark capture file
- Network traffic analysis report
- List of identified network issues
- Security incident report (if any)

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of network traffic capture
- Accuracy of packet analysis
- Effectiveness of issue identification
- Quality of the analysis report
- Adherence to network analysis best practices

## Resources
- Wireshark documentation
- Wireshark filters cheat sheet
- Network troubleshooting guides
- Security incident detection best practices
