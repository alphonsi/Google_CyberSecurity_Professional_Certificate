# Portfolio Activity - Networks and Network Security

## Activity Overview
This activity is designed to help you apply the knowledge and skills gained from the Networks and Network Security course to a real-world scenario. You will configure a small network, implement security controls, and monitor network traffic.

## Scenario
You are a junior network administrator at "TechCorp," a small technology company. Your manager has asked you to configure the company's network and implement security controls to protect it from external threats.

## Task 1: Network Design
- Design a small office network with the following components:
  - Router
  - Switch
  - Firewall
  - Wireless access point
  - Servers (web server, file server, DNS server)
  - Workstations
- Create a network diagram using tools like Visio or draw.io

## Task 2: IP Addressing Plan
- Design an IP addressing plan for the network
- Assign IP addresses to all devices
- Create a subnetting scheme for the network
- Document the IP addressing plan

## Task 3: Router Configuration
- Configure a router with the following:
  - Basic router settings (hostname, passwords, banners)
  - IP addresses on interfaces
  - Routing (static routing or dynamic routing)
  - Access control lists (ACLs)
- Verify router configuration

## Task 4: Switch Configuration
- Configure a switch with the following:
  - Basic switch settings (hostname, passwords, banners)
  - VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
  - VLAN trunking
  - Port security
- Verify switch configuration

## Task 5: Firewall Configuration
- Configure a firewall with the following:
  - Security zones (trust, untrust, DMZ)
  - Access control policies
  - NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Verify firewall configuration

## Task 6: Wireless Network Configuration
- Configure a wireless access point with the following:
  - SSID (Service Set Identifier)
  - Security settings (WPA3)
  - Wireless channels
  - Signal strength
- Verify wireless network configuration

## Task 7: Network Monitoring and Analysis
- Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic
- Identify network issues and security incidents
- Create a network traffic report

## Task 8: Network Hardening
- Implement network hardening techniques:
  - Disable unnecessary services
  - Implement strong passwords
  - Enable encryption
  - Update firmware
- Verify network hardening

## Deliverables
- Network diagram
- IP addressing plan
- Router configuration file
- Switch configuration file
- Firewall configuration file
- Wireless network configuration file
- Wireshark capture file
- Network traffic report
- Network hardening report

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of network design
- Accuracy of IP addressing plan
- Effectiveness of security controls
- Quality of network monitoring
- Adherence to network security best practices

## Resources
- Network diagramming tools (Visio, draw.io)
- Cisco Packet Tracer (for simulation)
- Wireshark
- Network security best practices
- Router/switch/firewall documentation
