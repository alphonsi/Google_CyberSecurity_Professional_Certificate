# Manage Security Risks - Summary Notes (Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate)

## Module 1: Introduction to Risk Management

### What is Risk Management?
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks, followed by the coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events. In cybersecurity, risk management focuses on protecting organizational assets from threats.

### Importance of Risk Management
- Helps organizations make informed decisions about security investments

### Key Risk Management Terminology
- **Risk**: The potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset
- **Threat**: A potential cause of harm to an asset
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that could be exploited by a threat
- **Asset**: Something of value to an organization
- **Impact**: The effect of a risk event on an asset
- **Likelihood**: The probability of a risk event occurring

## Module 2: Risk Assessment Processes

- Prioritizing threats based on impact

### Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization
- Identifying vulnerabilities in systems and processes
- Assessing vulnerability severity using CVSS scores
- Prioritizing vulnerabilities for remediation
- Understanding vulnerability exploitability

### Risk Calculation and Scoring
- **Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**
- Using risk matrices to categorize risks (low, medium, high, critical)
- Prioritizing risks based on their scores
- Communicating risk scores to stakeholders

## Module 3: Threat Modeling

### Threat Modeling Concepts
- Identifying potential threats to systems and applications
- Understanding threat actor capabilities and motivations

- **CVSS**: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (v3.1)
- **DREAD**: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability

### Threat Mitigation Strategies
- **Preventive Controls**: Stop threats from occurring
- **Detective Controls**: Identify threats that have occurred
- **Corrective Controls**: Respond to and mitigate threats
- **Compensating Controls**: Provide alternative protection

## Module 4: Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Management Processes
1. **Discovery**: Identifying assets and vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Evaluating vulnerability severity
3. **Prioritization**: Determining which vulnerabilities to fix first
4. **Remediation**: Applying patches or fixes
5. **Verification**: Ensuring vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Reporting**: Communicating vulnerability status

### Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment
- Using vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Nessus)
- Understanding scan results
- Validating vulnerabilities
- False positive identification and handling

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **Base Score**: Intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability
- **Temporal Score**: Current characteristics of a vulnerability
- **Environmental Score**: Context-specific characteristics
- **Overall Score**: Combined score (0-10, with 10 being most severe)

### Remediation Planning and Execution
- Creating remediation plans
- Assigning responsibilities
- Setting timelines for fixes
- Monitoring remediation progress
- Documenting remediation activities

## Module 5: Risk Treatment Strategies

### Risk Treatment Options
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk
- **Risk Transfer**: Shifting risk to another party (e.g., insurance)
- **Risk Acceptance**: Acknowledging and accepting a risk
- **Risk Avoidance**: Eliminating the risk by stopping the activity
- **Risk Sharing**: Distributing risk among multiple parties

### Risk Mitigation Techniques
- Implementing security controls
- Hardening systems and applications
- Training employees on security awareness
- Regularly updating software and systems
- Implementing access controls

### Risk Acceptance Criteria
- Determining when to accept a risk
- Documenting risk acceptance decisions
- Monitoring accepted risks
- Reassessing risks on a regular basis

### Risk Communication
- Communicating risks to stakeholders
- Tailoring communication to audience
- Documenting risk management activities
- Reporting risk status to management

## Module 6: Security Controls Evaluation

### Security Controls Classification
- **Preventive Controls**: Stop threats from occurring (firewalls, access controls)
- **Detective Controls**: Identify threats that have occurred (security monitoring, audits)
- **Corrective Controls**: Respond to and mitigate threats (incident response, backups)

### Control Effectiveness Evaluation
- Assessing if controls are working as intended
- Testing control effectiveness
- Identifying control gaps
- Optimizing controls for better performance

### Control Implementation and Monitoring
- Implementing security controls
- Monitoring control performance
- Documenting control activities
- Ensuring control continuity

### Control Testing and Validation
- Testing controls regularly
- Validating control effectiveness
- Identifying control deficiencies
- Implementing improvements

## Module 7: Security Governance and Policies

### Security Governance Frameworks

- **ITIL**: Information Technology Infrastructure Library
- **ISO 27001**: International standard for information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

### Security Policies and Procedures
- Developing security policies
