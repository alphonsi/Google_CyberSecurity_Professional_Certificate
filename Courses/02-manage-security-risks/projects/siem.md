# SIEM Configuration and Analysis

## SIEM Overview
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems collect and analyze security log data from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents. This activity will guide you through configuring a SIEM system and analyzing security events.

## Scenario
You are a security analyst at "TechCorp" and have been tasked with setting up and configuring a SIEM system to monitor the company's customer data storage system.

## Task 1: SIEM System Selection
- Research and evaluate different SIEM solutions (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar, etc.)
- Select a SIEM system based on organizational needs and budget

## Task 2: Data Source Configuration
- Identify data sources to be monitored (firewalls, servers, databases, applications)
- Configure data collection from each source
- Test data ingestion to ensure logs are being collected

## Task 3: Log Processing and Normalization
- Configure log parsing and normalization
- Define log fields and data types
- Set up log retention policies

## Task 4: Event Correlation Rules
- Create event correlation rules to detect security incidents
- Define rule conditions and thresholds
- Test correlation rules to ensure they work correctly

## Task 5: Alert Configuration
- Configure alert notifications for security incidents
- Define alert severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Set up alert distribution channels (email, Slack, SMS)

## Task 6: Dashboards and Reports
- Create security dashboards to visualize log data
- Configure reports for compliance and management purposes
- Set up scheduled report generation

## Task 7: Security Event Analysis
- Analyze security events using SIEM search and filtering capabilities
- Identify patterns and anomalies in log data
- Investigate potential security incidents

## Task 8: Incident Response Integration
- Integrate SIEM with incident response tools and processes
- Create playbooks for common security incidents
- Test incident response workflows

## Deliverables
- SIEM configuration documentation
- Event correlation rules
- Alert configuration settings
- Security dashboards and reports
- Incident response playbooks

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of data source configuration
- Effectiveness of event correlation rules
- Quality of security dashboards and reports
- Integration with incident response processes
- Adherence to SIEM best practices

## Resources
- SIEM documentation and user guides
- Security log management best practices
- Incident response framework guidelines
- SIEM configuration templates
