# Portfolio Activity - Manage Security Risks

## Activity Overview
This activity is designed to help you apply the knowledge and skills gained from the Manage Security Risks course to a real-world scenario. You will complete a risk assessment for a fictional organization and develop a risk management plan.

## Scenario
You are a security analyst at "TechCorp," a mid-sized technology company that provides cloud-based services. Your manager has asked you to conduct a risk assessment of the company's customer data storage system.

## Task 1: Asset Identification and Valuation
- Identify all assets related to customer data storage
- Assign value to each asset based on importance to the organization
- Classify assets by sensitivity and criticality

## Task 2: Threat Assessment
- Identify potential threats to customer data storage
- Classify threats by type (cyber, physical, human)
- Assess threat likelihood and capability
- Prioritize threats based on impact

## Task 3: Vulnerability Assessment
- Identify vulnerabilities in the customer data storage system
- Assess vulnerability severity using CVSS scores
- Prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation
- Understand vulnerability exploitability

## Task 4: Risk Calculation and Scoring
- Calculate risk scores using the formula: Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact
- Use a risk matrix to categorize risks (low, medium, high, critical)
- Prioritize risks based on their scores

## Task 5: Risk Treatment Plan
- Develop a risk treatment plan for high and critical risks
- Identify appropriate risk treatment strategies (mitigation, transfer, acceptance, avoidance)
- Create a remediation plan with timelines and responsibilities

## Task 6: Security Controls Evaluation
- Evaluate existing security controls for customer data storage
- Identify control gaps and weaknesses
- Recommend improvements to security controls

## Task 7: Risk Monitoring and Reporting
- Develop a risk monitoring plan
- Identify key risk indicators (KRIs)
- Create a risk report for management

## Deliverables
- Asset valuation spreadsheet
- Threat assessment report
- Vulnerability assessment report
- Risk matrix and scoring table
- Risk treatment plan
- Security controls evaluation report
- Risk monitoring and reporting plan

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of asset identification
- Accuracy of threat assessment
- Effectiveness of risk treatment strategies
- Quality of risk reporting
- Adherence to risk management best practices

## Resources
- Risk management frameworks (NIST RMF, ISO 31000)
- CVSS v3.1 scoring guide
- Risk assessment templates
- Security controls catalog
