# Shell Scripting Activity - Linux Automation

## Activity Overview
This activity is designed to help you practice shell scripting skills by creating scripts to automate common Linux tasks.

## Scenario
You are a junior system administrator at "TechCorp," a small technology company. Your manager has asked you to create shell scripts to automate routine system administration tasks.

## Task 1: System Information Script
- Create a shell script that displays system information
- Include information such as hostname, operating system, kernel version, and uptime
- Format the output in a readable way
- Make the script executable
- Test the script

## Task 2: File Backup Script
- Create a shell script that backs up specified files or directories
- Allow the user to specify the source and destination paths
- Compress the backup file
- Verify the backup is created correctly
- Test the script

## Task 3: User Management Script
- Create a shell script that creates new user accounts
- Allow the user to specify the username and optional home directory
- Set a default password for new users
- Test the script

## Task 4: Log Analysis Script
- Create a shell script that analyzes system logs
- Search for specific patterns in the logs
- Count occurrences of specific events
- Generate a report with the analysis results
- Test the script

## Task 5: System Monitoring Script
- Create a shell script that monitors system resources
- Display CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage
- Set thresholds for alerting
- Send an email alert if thresholds are exceeded
- Test the script

## Deliverables
- System information script
- File backup script
- User management script
- Log analysis script
- System monitoring script
- Test results
