# Portfolio Activity - Linux and SQL

## Activity Overview
This activity is designed to help you apply the knowledge and skills gained from the Linux and SQL course to a real-world scenario. You will use Linux commands to manage files and directories, and SQL to query and analyze data.

## Scenario
You are a junior security analyst at "TechCorp," a small technology company. Your manager has asked you to analyze log data from the company's web server to identify potential security incidents.

## Task 1: Linux File Management
- Navigate to the log directory
- List all log files in the directory
- Check the permissions of the log files
- Create a backup of the log files
- Compress the backup file

## Task 2: Linux Command Line Analysis
- Use grep to search for specific patterns in the log files
- Use awk to extract specific fields from the log files
- Use sort and uniq to count occurrences of specific events
- Create a shell script to automate the analysis process
- Run the shell script to generate a report

## Task 3: SQL Database Setup
- Create a database for storing log data
- Create a table to store web server logs
- Insert sample log data into the table
- Verify the data is inserted correctly

## Task 4: SQL Queries
- Write a query to select all log entries
- Write a query to select log entries for a specific date range
- Write a query to select log entries from a specific IP address
- Write a query to count the number of log entries per IP address
- Write a query to find the most frequent user agents

## Task 5: SQL Joins and Subqueries
- Create a table to store IP address information
- Insert sample IP address data into the table
- Write a query to join the log table with the IP address table
- Write a query to find log entries from specific countries
- Write a query using a subquery to find log entries with errors

## Task 6: Database Security
- Create a new user account with limited permissions
- Grant the user read access to the log table
- Revoke unnecessary permissions
- Test the user's permissions
- Implement database encryption

## Deliverables
- Linux shell script
- SQL queries
- SQL database file
- Analysis report
- Security recommendations

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of the analysis
- Accuracy of the SQL queries
- Effectiveness of the shell script
- Quality of the analysis report
- Adherence to security best practices

## Resources
- Linux documentation
- SQL tutorials
- Web server log formats
- Database security best practices
- Text processing commands (grep, awk, sed)
