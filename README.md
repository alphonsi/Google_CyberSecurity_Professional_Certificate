### Google_CyberSecurity_Professional_Certificate
My hands-on work, notes, labs, and projects from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera. Building entry-level cybersecurity skills (Python, Linux, SQL, SIEM, incident response) 



# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

This repository showcases my journey through the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera — a beginner-friendly, 9-course program created by Google experts to prepare for entry-level roles like **Cybersecurity Analyst** or **SOC Analyst**.

No prior experience required — just like me starting from my ALX Software Engineering background (apps, Python, Linux basics) and moving into defense/blue-team work.

### Program Overview
- **Platform**: Coursera (by Google)
- **Courses**: 9 (including new AI-focused content)
- **Duration**: ~6 months at 7–10 hours/week (~170 hours total)
- **Key Focus**: Hands-on skills in threat detection, incident response, Python automation, Linux/SQL for security, networks, SIEM tools, vulnerability management + **AI in cybersecurity** (prioritizing alerts, bug detection, refining code).
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, Linux, SQL, Wireshark, SIEM (e.g., Chronicle/Splunk basics), IDS (e.g., Suricata), bash scripting, incident playbooks.
- **Outcomes**: Prepares for CompTIA Security+; job connections via Google; real-world labs & simulations.
- **Link**: [Coursera Program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity)

### Course List
1. Foundations of Cybersecurity  
2. Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks  
3. Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security  
4. Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL  
5. Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities  
6. Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response  
7. Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python  
8. Put It to Work: Prepare for Cybersecurity Jobs  
9. Accelerate Your Job Search with AI  

### What You'll Find in This Repo
- **Labs & Scripts** — Python security automation, log parsing, bash/Linux hardening scripts, SQL queries for threat hunting.
- **Write-ups & Notes** — Summaries of key concepts (e.g., NIST CSF, CIA triad, OWASP, incident response steps), Wireshark analysis examples.
- **Playbooks & Templates** — Markdown incident response templates, threat modeling docs.
- **AI Security Experiments** — Notes/code from new AI modules (using AI to prioritize alerts, identify vulnerabilities, etc.).
- **Portfolio Pieces** — Small projects combining dev + cyber (e.g., simple log analyzer script, network traffic summary).

Everything here is from course labs, personal extensions, or write-ups — no sensitive data shared.

### Why I'm Doing This
After completing ALX Software Engineering (building apps & projects), I'm transitioning to cybersecurity to focus on **secure systems**, **blue-team defense**, and protecting code/infrastructure. This cert bridges my dev skills with security fundamentals — perfect for roles in SOCs or secure app development.
